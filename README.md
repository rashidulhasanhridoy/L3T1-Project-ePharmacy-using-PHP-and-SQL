ePharmacy is an online market place of medicine. It works like Uber. Anyone with a drug license can sell medicine here. To do this, one needs to sign up and give the required information. Admin checks all information and approves the account. The Admin panel has many features these - make this software more secure and user-friendly. Admin can control all things. Customers can create an account easily and buy the required medicine. Customers can select the nearest pharmacy and give a review based on service. To maintain quality, a seller account will be blocked if he - she getting bad reviews continuously. Admin can block seller or buyer account anytime. Customers can check the status of their orders.  I tried my best to enhance security. The log in the system is very secure. The seller can easily update product information. I developed this project using PHP, JavaScript, and MySQL. If anyone wants to contribute to this project, please email me.
