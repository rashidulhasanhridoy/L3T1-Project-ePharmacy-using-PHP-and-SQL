ePharmacy is a web-based software. Anyone can sell medicines here if they want. After creating the pharmacy account, the account can be used only with the approval of the admin. There are arrangements to give a review based on the order. Both buyers and sellers will be able to review it. If someone's review is too bad, the admin can deactivate his account. In this case, if he is a seller, he will not be able to sell the product and if he is a buyer, he will not be able to create any new order. The admin can reactivate the account if he wants.

If a pharmacy does not follow the rules, its account is locked. If the account is locked, he will no longer be able to login to the account. After reactivating the admin, he can log in.

The customer will know the status of his order very easily. After submitting the order, the status will show pending. When the order from the pharmacy is ready, the status will show ready. This means that the customer can now receive the order if he wants. The status will be received after the order is received.

When creating a customer order, he will first select the nearest pharmacy, then buy the product. If the customer wants, he can leave the order for submission in the future without submitting it.

Admin can easily control the whole system. After creating a new admin account, the approval of another admin is required. Moreover, an admin can deactivate another admin's account and later activate it for security reasons.

There are 16 pages for admin, 10 for customers, and 12 for pharmacy. If a customer keeps many tabs open in the browser, he can log out from any page, and at the same time, all the tabs will be logged out.

In the case of the product update, the seller must update excluding the products sold.

If the customer places 10 orders for a product, and if the product has 6, then the customer will be shown, you can now buy 8 products.
